# number-guessing-game-using-python
This Python game challenges players to guess a random number (default 1â€“100) within 10 attempts, guided by smart hints. After the first round, players can set custom ranges, even negatives, for unique sessions. A persistent best score tracks efficiency, while input validation, menus, and feedback ensure a smooth, engaging, and scalable experience.
